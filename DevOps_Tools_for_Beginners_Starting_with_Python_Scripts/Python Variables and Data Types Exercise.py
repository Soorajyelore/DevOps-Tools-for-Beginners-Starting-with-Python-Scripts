# Task 1: Create a variable named 'age' and assign it your age as an integer
# Your code here

# Task 2: Create a variable named 'height' and assign it your height in meters as a float
# Your code here

# Task 3: Create a variable named 'name' and assign it your name as a string
# Your code here

# Task 4: Create a variable named 'is_student' and assign it a boolean value
# Your code here

# Task 5: Print all variables using an f-string
# Your code here

# Task 6: Increase the 'age' variable by 1
# Your code here

# Task 7: Multiply the 'height' variable by 100 to convert it to centimeters
# Your code here

# Task 8: Add " is my name" to the 'name' variable

# Task 10: Print the modified variables using an f-string
# Your code here

# Step 1: Create variables
